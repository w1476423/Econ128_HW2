Problem 1
Using SQL, compute the result containing the total payroll and winning percentage (number of wins / number of games * 100) for each team (that is, for each teamID and yearID combination).
Hint: Be sure to perform a groupby on the fields teamID and yearID

Problem 2
Write code to printout the teamID that had the highest WinningPercentage over total sepending (salaries).

Problem 3
Write code to produce plots that illustrate the team's total spending (salaries) conditioned on time (from 1990-2014), specifically for teamID='OAK'.

Problem 4
Write code to discretize year into five time periods (you can use pandas.cut to accomplish this) and then make a scatterplot showing mean winning percentage (y-axis) vs. mean payroll (x-axis) for each of the five time periods.
What can you say about team payrolls across these periods? Are there any teams that standout as being particularly good at paying for wins across these time periods? What can you say about the Oakland Aâ€™s spending efficiency across these time periods (labeling points in the scatterplot can help interpretation).
